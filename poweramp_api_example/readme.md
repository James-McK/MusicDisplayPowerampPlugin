# Poweramp Intent APIs Example
============================================

This is an example project that demonstrates Poweramp Intent based APIs. These APIs are focused on simplicity: you can just
throw a simple Intent to Poweramp to play something, command Poweramp to do something, or get some Poweramp state from the published Intents.
While being simple the Intent APIs provide almost complete control over Poweramp.
The intents can be sent programmatically or by the automation apps.
