A [Poweramp](https://powerampapp.com/) plugin that sends information on the currently playing song to the specified server. (Note: doesn't currently have a UI to configure it, so for now it requires editing and compiling yourself)

Only really meant to work with the server I wrote and probably not useful to anybody else, but it's here just in case! See https://mck.is/blog/2024/small-projects-for-fun/ for more details.
